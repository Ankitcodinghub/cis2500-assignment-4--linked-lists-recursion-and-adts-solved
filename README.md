Question 1a: Advanced Linked Lists

[bonus 10% for Q1 โ doubly linked lists]

typedef struct NODE { typedef struct NODE { value_typekey_type key value; ; or value_typekey_type key; value;

struct NODE * next; struct NODE * next; struct NODE * sort; struct NODE * sort;

} Node; struct NODE * prev; struct NODE * prev_sorted;

} Node;

In this linked list:

โข The datatype for the value being stored is called value_type

โข The datatype for the key being stored is called key_type

โข As in lab 4, next links to the node in the order it was added to the list (either at the head or the tail) o This will be referred to as insertion order

โข Similar to lab 4, sort links to the node where the key is greater or equal to its key o i.e. the list is kept in ascending order by key o This will be referred to as key sort order o Note: unlike lab 4, there is only one key

Create a Sorted List abstract data type

โข Has two heads (head for insertion order, head_sort for key sort order)

โข Has two tails (tail for insertion order, tail_sort for key sort order)

โข Has an int field called size that stored the node count (the number of elements in the list)

โข The datatype should be called Sorted_List

Note: technically you will be implementing only be a subset of the Sorted List ADT as you will not be asked to implement all functions of the full ADT

Functions to be implemented

All functions, except where noted, return SUCCESS if the function can complete or FAIL if not

โข int size (Sorted_List *)

o returns the number of nodes in the list (not SUCCESS/FAIL as the function cannot fail)

โข int push ( Sorted_List *, value_type , key_type )

o add the node to the head of the list

o the node must also be inserted in ascending sort order by key, using the sort link

โข int append ( Sorted_List * , value_type , key_type ) o similar to push, except the node gets added to tail

โข int remove_first ( Sorted_List * , value_type * , key_type *) o removes the node from the head of the list

o returns the value and key of the removed node through the parameter values

(and frees the node) o returns SUCCESS (alternatively you can change the signature to return void) o remember to update the sort order links

ยง if not using doubly linked lists, you will need to find the previous sorted node to change its sort order link

โข int remove_last ( Sorted_List * , value_type * , key_type * )

o similar to remove_first, except it removes the node from the tail

โข int remove_smallest_key ( Sorted_List * , value_type * , key_type * ) o removes the node with the smallest key

o returns the value and key of the removed node (and frees the node) o remember to update the insertion order links

ยง if not using doubly linked lists, you will need to find the previous insert order node to change its insertion order link

โข int remove_largest_key ( Sorted_List * , value_type * , key_type * )

o similar to remove_smallest_key, except it removes the node with the largest key

โข void empty_list ( Sorted_List *)

o empties the contents of the list

o remember to free the memory of the contents

โข void destroy_list ( Sorted_List *)

o empties the contents of the list, as well as freeing the list itself

To test the Sorted List ADT

Write two programs called a4q1a_char.c and a4q1a_int.c

โข Data types used o a4q1a_int.c

ยง has its value_type datatype set equal to int

ยง has it key_type datatype set equal to double o a4q1a_char.c

ยง has its value_type datatype set equal to char[80]

โข i.e. it can take strings up to 79 characters in length

๏ง has its key_type datatype set equal to int

โข its value is set equal to the length of the string

โข Both programs read in a text file that contains a series of commands, one per line

(i.e each ending with a newline) o The name of the text file should be entered as a command line argument

๏ง If there is no file name, read from stdin

โข this can use IO redirect, i.e. a4q1a_int &lt; filename.txt

๏ง If using keyboard input, exit using ^d

โข All commands are echoed to stdout, followed by a colon :, o After that the results of the command follows,

๏ง usually on the same line following 11 โ strlen(cmd name) spaces or on the next line when noted

Note: Silent commands do not have the colon : after the command, but rather after the command name

โข Remember to free the sorted list at the end of the program (use destroy_list)

General Note: The two programs should be almost identical, with the following differences o The file input will be slightly different depending on the data type and nature of the input data o Your will have to write similar, but not identical void print_list_all ( Sorted_List * ) and void print_list_sort ( Sorted_List * ) functions

ยง These functions print out the lists according to their respective sort orders

ยง See the report commands section below for details

(the print_all and print_sort commands)

o You will have to have your make file recompile all files that mention or use value_type and key_type variables or Sort_List structs when compiling the two programs

ยง In specific, use #ifdef CHAR to compile using the char[80] typedef definition of value_type

and #ifdef INT to compile using the int typedef definition of value_type

ยง E.g. if you stored all your Sort_List ADT functions in a single file called sort_list.c Then for a4q1a_char.c you could have in your make file a command like

gcc -Wall -ansi -DCHAR -c sort_list.c

List of Commands

Silent Commands (modifies the list but does not print anything other than the command itself)

โข a = append

o a4q1a_int.c

ยง input line: a key value

note: there can be any number of spaces in the input been the command and args, or between args

ยง example

โข commands, as stored in the input file a 3.27 1427 a 0.94 984 a 7.21 346

๏ง output (11 โ 1 spaces after the colon)

a: 3.27 1427 a: 0.94 984 a: 7.21 346

o a4q1a_char.c

ยง input line: a value

ยง example

โข commands, as stored in the input file

a The sun did not shine. a It was too wet to play. a So we sat in the house a All that cold, cold, wet day.

Note: skip the white space between the command โaโ and the input string

โข The key values for the above are 22, 23, 22, 29 o e.g. strlen(โThe sun did not shine.โ) == 22

โข output (11 โ 1 spaces after the colon)

a: The sun did not shine. a: It was too wet to play. a: So we sat in the house a: All that cold, cold, wet day.

โข p = push o same as a except it pushes instead of appends the key/value pair onto the list

Verbose Commands (modifies the list and then reports to stdout)

โข rem_first = remove first node of the list by insertion order o also prints the elementโs key-value pair, with two spaces between the key and the value

o Example for a4q1a_int.c assuming the first list element key is 2.465 and value is 212 rem_first: 2.465 212

o Note the two spaces after rem_first: ๏ง โrem_firstโ is 9 characters in length, so the number of spaces following should be 11 โ 9 = 2

โข rem_last = remove last node of the list by insertion order and print the elementโs key-value pair

โข rem_small = remove the node with the smallest key and print the elementโs key-value pair โข rem_large = remove the node with the largest key and print the elementโs key-value pair

โข empty = empty the list o the output of this command should be

empty: size = 0

Report Commands (prints information, but does not modify the list)

โข size = size of sorted linked list

o if there are 21 nodes in the list it prints size: List size = 21

โข print_all = print list in insertion order o The type of order is printed on the same line as the command o The list starts printing on the next line, one element per line

o Each element is prefaced by 5 spaces, then the key, then 2 spaces, then the value o Example using the input from the append examples

๏ง a4q1a_int.c print_all: Insertion Order

3.27 1427

0.94 984

7.21 346

๏ง a4q1a_char.c print_all: Insertion Order

22 The sun did not shine.

23 It was too wet to play.

22 So we sat in the house 29 All that cold, cold, wet day.

โข print_sort = print list in key sort order o The output is the same as with print_all except the order of the lines are in key sort order and the command line will read Key Sort Order

o Example using the input from the append examples

๏ง a4q1a_int.c print_sort: Key Sort Order

0.94 984

3.27 1427

7.21 346

๏ง a4q1a_char.c

print_sort: Key Sort Order

22 The sun did not shine.

22 So we sat in the house

23 It was too wet to play.

29 All that cold, cold, wet day.
